# AI / LLM Disclosure (Week 1)

- **Student:** <your name / UVic ID>
- **Repo:** <link to your `fall25-csc-bioinf` repo>
- **Assignment:** Week 1 – de Bruijn assembler (Python → Codon) + CI + reproducibility

## Models & Tools
| Purpose | Model/Version | Access Method | Date |
|---|---|---|---|
| Brainstorm/translation (Mandarin README) | <model name/version> | <ChatGPT/AI Studio/etc> | <YYYY-MM-DD> |
| Code porting (Python→Codon) |  |  |  |
| Debugging |  |  |  |

## Prompts
- Paste exact prompts or link to files under `week1/prompts/`.

## Outputs Used
- List code files or sections that originated from AI assistance.

## Verification & Understanding
- How you validated correctness (unit tests, small datasets, diff vs Python results).  
- What you learned and can defend in a cold oral check.

## Risks & Mitigations
- Hallucinated flags, language mismatches, hidden global state.  
- How you mitigated (pinning versions, reading docs, small test first, code review).
